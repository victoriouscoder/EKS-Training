# Route 53

Hosted names is beyond the scope of this class.  We focus here on mapping a record set to a Load Balancer that points to our Nginx Ingress controller. 

Inside Hosted Zones you can create a new A record that points to the load balancer.

We can add another wildcard to take on all other records to make it simple.

Now we are all mapped.  In a few minutes, you can hit the IP address and it should route to the service. The only issue you might encounter is that the connection is not encrypted with TLS.  We'll fix that in the next section!
