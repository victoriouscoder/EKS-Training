# Visualization 

The basic Kubernetes GUI is pretty lame when you consider some other options that are much better.  Two to consider here are [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) and [K9s](https://k9scli.io/). 

## Lens

Lens is a great native desktop application that allows you to visualize multiple Kubernetes clusters. 

## K9s

K9s is a TUI (text user interface) that is great for installing on bastion hosts when your primary laptop can't reach it.  Installation is simple following the instructions on [the website](https://k9scli.io/).
